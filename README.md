# CORONA VIRUS SCRAPER AND VISUALIZER FOR QUEBEC AND ONTARIO

I was super impressed by https://covid19stats.alberta.ca/ so I decided to create something similar for the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. I have scraped data and made visualizations and put them in :

## Getting Started 

`bash src/scripts/quebec.sh`

Updates the latest from https://www.quebec.ca/sante/problemes-de-sante/a-z/coronavirus-2019/situation-coronavirus-quebec/

 and updates the plotly graphs in plotly/

`bash src/scripts/ontario.sh`

does the same thing for Ontario 'https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus'


For more interaction go to Notebooks but the scripts are all in `src/scripts/make_graphs_`
